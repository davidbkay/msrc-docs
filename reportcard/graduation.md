title: High School Graduation
---

This section reports the four-year adjusted ***cohort*** graduation rate for the prior school year. Rates are reported for all students and for student subgroups, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, economically disadvantaged, migrant status, English language learner status, and homelessness. Due to the timeline required for reporting summer activity for seniors, the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is always lagged one year.

::: tip Cohort
The four-year adjusted cohort is based on the number of students who entered grade 9 (or the earliest high school grade) or who transferred into the cohort during grades 9 through 12 from out-of-state, minus any students who left the cohort by transferring out-of-state or exiting to a private or approved homeschool program.
