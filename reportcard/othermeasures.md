ESSA requires states to report on factors affecting school climate. Included in the Mississippi Succeeds Report Card is information on:

## Chronically Absent Students

The percentage of students who were absent 10% or more of the time they were enrolled in a school or district. This includes both excused and unexcused absences. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of ten days to be included in the calculations.

## Post-Secondary Enrollment

The percentage of graduates who enrolled in public in-state colleges and universities within a year of graduating. This data is reported for the graduating class from the year prior and is lagged a year. For example, the 2017-18 report contains information for 2016 graduates.

## Preschool enrollment

The percent of students in a school or district who are enrolled in a district preschool program.

## Suspensions and Expulsions

The percentages of students who received one or more in-school suspension, out-of-school suspensions, or were expelled.

## Incidents of violence

The number of reported incidents of assault, bullying, extortion, fighting, gang-related, weapon possession, homicide, kidnapping, mayhem, poisoning, rape, robbery, stalking, and sexual battery. This number does not include incidents reported as non-criminal behavior.

## Advenced Course Participation

Participation in advanced coursework, including Dual Credit/Dual Enrollment, Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Industry Certification.
