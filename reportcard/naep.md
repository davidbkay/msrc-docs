Mississippi participates in the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) biennial reading and mathematics assessments for 4th and 8th grade students. NAEP results provide a historical view of Mississippiâ€™s achievement in these subject areas across time and in comparison to other states and the nation.

Results include the percentage of 4th and 8th grade students at each NAEP achievement level (Below Basic, Basic, Proficient, and Advanced) for all students and student subgroups.
