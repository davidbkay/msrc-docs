title: Accountability Data
---

The Mississippi Succeeds Report Card focuses on relevant student, school and district data that detail performance, growth, success and school climate.

## Proficiency & Performance

Did the students meet achievement goals?

## Growth

Are students improving as expected?

## Participation

Did students participate in classes/assessments?

## Graduation Rate

This section reports the four-year adjusted ***cohort*** graduation rate for the prior school year. Rates are reported for all students and for student subgroups, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, economically disadvantaged, migrant status, English language learner status, and homelessness. Due to the timeline required for reporting summer activity for seniors, the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is always lagged one year.

::: tip Cohort
The four-year adjusted cohort is based on the number of students who entered grade 9 (or the earliest high school grade) or who transferred into the cohort during grades 9 through 12 from out-of-state, minus any students who left the cohort by transferring out-of-state or exiting to a private or approved homeschool program.

## College & Career Readiness

Did students meet national ACT benchmarks in Math and English?

## Acceleration

Did the student participate and perform well in accelerated courses, Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, dual credit/dual enrollment and industry certification?

## Assessment

Each year student knowledge in key academic areas is assessed using the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program (MAAP), which was implemented during the 2015-16 school year. MAAP assessment results are reported based on five (5) levels of performance:

**Minimal (Level 1)** – A student performing at Level 1 inconsistently demonstrates the knowledge or skills that define basic level performance.

**Basic (Level 2)** – Students at Level 2 demonstrate partial mastery of the knowledge and skills in the course and may experience difficulty in the next grade or course in the content area. These students are able to meet some of the content standards at a low level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency as specified by the grade-level content standards.

**Passing (Level 3)** – Students at Level 3 demonstrate general mastery of the knowledge and skills required for success in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform close to the level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency specified by the grade-level content standards. 

**Proficient (Level 4)** – Students at Level 4 demonstrate solid academic performance and mastery of the knowledge and skills required for success in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform at the level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency specified by the grade-level content standards.

**Advanced (Level 5)** – Students at the Level 5 consistently perform in a manner clearly beyond what is required to be successful in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform at a high level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency as specified by the grade-level content standards. 

### Alternate assessments

Students with significant cognitive disabilities participate in the State’s alternate assessment (MAAP-A) in the subjects of English language arts, mathematics, and science. MAAP-A assessment results are reported based on three (3) levels of performance:

**Basic** ─ Students at this level partially meet academic expectations for the knowledge, skills, and practices contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language arts and mathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course.

**Passing** ─ Students at this level approach academic expectations for the knowledge, skills, and practices contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language arts and mathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course.

**Proficient** ─ Students at this level meet academic expectations for the content knowledge and skills contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language arts and Mathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course.

Students in grades 3-8 are assessed in English language arts and mathematics, while 5th and 8th grade students are also assessed in basic science. For high school students, they are assessed once in English II, Algebra I, Biology I, and U.S. History. 
Students with disabilities who require an alternate assessment based on alternate academic achievement standards are assessed using the MAAP Alternate assessment.

This section details the percentage of students who participated in the 2017-18 statewide assessments and the percentage of students at each level of performance. It also includes the number and percentage of students who participated in the alternate assessment. Information is reported for all students and by student subgroups, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, economically disadvantaged, migrant status, English language learner status, foster care status, military-connectedness and homelessness.
