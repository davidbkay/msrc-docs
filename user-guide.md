**Accountability Grades**

The Mississippi Statewide Accountability System assigns a performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F to each school and district based on points earned. Schools and districts earn points in several categories, which include student achievement, individual growth, and participation on statewide assessments; and for graduation, college and career readiness, and participation and performance on accelerated courseworkfor high schools.

The Mississippi State Board of Education established the following points for accountability grades.

| **Grade** | **Districts** | **Elementary and Middle Schools** | **High Schools** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | ≥668 | ≥442 | ≥754 |
| B | 599 | 377 | 648 |
| C | 536 | 328 | 584 |
| D | 489 | 269 | 510 |
| F | \&lt; 489 | \&lt; 269 | \&lt; 510 |

Districts and Schools with &quot;\*&quot; next to the grade received unofficial grades for 2018.

Schools and districts earn points based on performance in the following areas:

- Proficiency/Performance on State Assessments – Did the student meet achievement expectations?
- Growth – Did the student improve as expected?
- Participation – Did the student participate in assessments/classes?
- Graduation rates – Did the student graduate high school as expected in four years?
- College and Career Readiness – Did the student meet the ACT national benchmarks in Math and English?
- Acceleration – Did the student participate and perform well in accelerated courses, such as Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, dual credit/dual enrollment and industry certification?

Here are the categories in which points can be earned:

| **Purpose Statement** | This companion document to the Mississippi Succeeds Annual Report Card is provided to clarify the report card requirements under Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA).  ESSA requires that each state and local educational agency, or LEA (e.g., school district or public school), prepare an annual report card related to student achievement, accountability, teacher qualifications, school climate, and per-pupil expenditure for public schools. |
| --- | --- |
| **Terminology** | The following terms are used throughout the report card.

| **Term** | **Defined** |
| --- | --- |
| ESSA | 2015 Ffederal Every Student Succeeds Act |
| ELA | English Language Arts |
| MDE | Mississippi Department of Education |
| MAAP | Mississippi Academic Assessment Program |
| NAEP | National Assessment of Educational Progress |
| SWD | Students with Disabilities |
| Suppression Rule | When the number of students in a reporting category is less than 10, the subgroup data will display &quot;\&lt;10&quot;. In a graphical representation of the data, the data may not be displayed. Percentages less than 5% or greater than 95% will also be changed to display &quot;\&lt;5%&quot; or &quot;\&gt;95%&quot; in some categories. If a percentage cannot be displayed and it is part of a series of data, such as levels of performance, the data will be converted to ranges (Ex: &quot;11-20%&quot;) to protect other data from being disclosed. |
| Military Connected | A student who is a dependent of a member of the Active Duty Forces, National Guard, or Reserve Forces |
| Migrant | A migrant child is between three and twenty-one years of age and has moved across a school district line during the previous thirty-six months either because they are a migrant agricultural worker or because their parents or guardians are. A migrant agricultural worker is someone who regularly travels long distances, typically following the seasons, to find work producing, harvesting, or processing livestock, poultry, fish, shellfish, dairy, and related products.  |
| Homeless | A homeless student is defined as a child and youth who &quot;lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,&quot; including sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or similar reasons; living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or campgrounds due to lack of alternative accommodations; living in emergency or transitional shelters; and living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar places.  |
| Foster Care | A child, up to age 18 or 21, placed in the care of the Mississippi  Department of Child Protection Services by either a voluntary placement agreement with the biological family, adoptive family, legal guardian, or by a court commitment order. |

  |
| **Teacher Data** | This section details the professional qualifications of public educators in the state, including:
- the percentage of teachers, principals, and other school leaders who are inexperienced (\&lt;3 years in education)
- the percentage of teachers who have emergency and provisional credentials
- the percentage of teachers not teaching in a subject or field for which he or she is certified or licensed
The information is also reported by low-poverty and high-poverty school designations. A high-poverty school is one where \&gt;94% of students are eligible for free or reduce lunch, while a low-poverty school is one where \&lt;63% of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch.Teacher data is reported as Full Time Equivalents, or FTEs. A teacher who works all year with a full schedule equals one FTE. Teachers who work part-time or for a partial year will equal less than one FTE. Teachers may be counted in one or more category by FTE percentage. For example, a teacher who teaches Math and English, but is only certified in English, will count as both in-field and out-of-field. |
| **Statewide Assessment Results (Student Performance, Student Participation, and Alternate Participation)** | Each year student knowledge in key academic areas is assessed using the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program (MAAP), which was implemented during the 2015-16 school year. MAAP assessment results are reported based on five (5) levels of performance: Minimal (Level 1) – A student performing at Level 1 inconsistently demonstrates the knowledge or skills that define basic level performance. Basic (Level 2) – Students at Level 2 demonstrate partial mastery of the knowledge and skills in the course and may experience difficulty in the next grade or course in the content area. These students are able to meet some of the content standards at a low level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency as specified by the grade-level content standards. Passing (Level 3) – Students at Level 3 demonstrate general mastery of the knowledge and skills required for success in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform close to the level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency specified by the grade-level content standards.  Proficient (Level 4) – Students at Level 4 demonstrate solid academic performance and mastery of the knowledge and skills required for success in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform at the level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency specified by the grade-level content standards. Advanced (Level 5) – Students at the Level 5 consistently perform in a manner clearly beyond what is required to be successful in the grade or course in the content area. These students are able to perform at a high level of difficulty, complexity, or fluency as specified by the grade-level content standards.) Students with significant cognitive disabilities participate in the State&#39;s alternate assessment (MAAP-A) in the subjects of English Llanguage Aarts, mathematics, and science. MAAP-A assessment results are reported based on three (3) levels of performance: Basic ─Students at this levelpartially meet academic expectations for the knowledge, skills, and practices contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language arts and Mmathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course. Passing ─Students at this level approach academic expectations for the knowledge, skills, and practices contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language artsand Mmathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course. Proficient ─Students at this level meet academic expectations for the content knowledge and skills contained in the Dynamic Learning Maps Essential Elements for English language arts and Mathematics and contained in the Mississippi Science Extended Frameworks assessed at their grade level or course. Students in grades 3-8 are assessed in English Llanguage Aarts and mathematics, while 5th and 8th grade students are also assessed in basic science. For high school students, they are assessed once in English II, Algebra I, Biology I, and U.S. History. Students with disabilities who require an alternate assessment based on alternate academic achievement standards are assessed using the MAAP Alternate assessment. This section details the percentage of students who participated in the 2017-18 statewide assessments and the percentage of students at each level of performance. It also includes the number and percentage of students who participated in the alternate assessment. Information is reported for all students and by student subgroups, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, economically disadvantaged, migrant status, English language learner status, foster care status, military-connectedness and homelessness. |

# th
 grade students at each NAEP achievement level (_Below Basic, Basic, Proficient,_ and _Advanced_) for all students and student subgroups. |
| **High School Graduation** | This section reports the four-year adjusted cohort\* graduation rate for the prior school year. Rates are reported for all students and for student subgroups, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, economically disadvantaged, migrant status, English language learner status, and homelessness. Due to the timeline required for reporting summer activity for seniors, the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is always lagged one year. \*the four-year adjusted cohort is based on the number of students who entered grade 9 (or the earliest high school grade) or who transferred into the cohort during grades 9 through 12 from out-of-state, minus any students who left the cohort by transferring out-of-state or exiting to a private or approved homeschool program. |
| **Progress toward Statewide Goals** | ESSA required that states set long-term goals for student achievement on statewide assessments, graduation, and English language proficiency for English lLearners. In 2015, MDE set the following goals for Mississippi schools to achieve by the end of the 2024-25 school year:
- 70% of all 3-8th grade students and all 3-8th grade student subgroups scoring Proficient or Advanced in English Llanguage Aarts and mathematics
- 70% of all 5th and 8th grade students and all 5th and 8th grade student subgroups scoring Proficient or Advanced in Science
- 70% of all high school students and all high school student subgroups scoring Proficient or Advanced in Algebra I, English II, Biology I, and U.S. History
- 90% of all high school students and all high school student subgroups graduate high school
- 70% of all English lLearners are making expected progress toward English language proficiency
 |
| **English Learners** |
- English Learner Proficiency – The number and percentage of English Learners who met the benchmarks to exit the English Learner program.
- English Learner Growth – The percent of English Learner students who met the growth expectations towards exiting the English Learner program in 5 years.
- English Learner Accountability Points – The percentage of points earned for English Learner Growth in the Statewide Accountability System.
- English Learner Accountability Grade – The letter grade that a school or district would earn including English Learner performance. English Learner performance will be part of the 2018-19 official grades.
