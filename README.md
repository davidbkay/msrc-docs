This companion document to the Mississippi Succeeds Annual Report Card is provided to clarify the report card requirements under Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA).  ESSA requires that each state and local educational agency, or LEA (e.g., school district or public school), prepare an annual report card related to student achievement, accountability, teacher qualifications, school climate, and per-pupil expenditure for public schools.
