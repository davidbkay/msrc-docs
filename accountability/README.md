## About

The Mississippi Statewide Accountability System assigns a performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F to each school and district based on points earned. Schools and districts earn points in several categories, which include student achievement, individual growth, and participation on statewide assessments; and for graduation, college and career readiness, and participation and performance on accelerated coursework for high schools.
